h1. rsnapshot

This directory should probably go into a separate salt formula. But as I do not have the time


h2. Useage

Read the rsnapshot doc (http://rsnapshot.org/rsnapshot/docs/docbook/rest.html) first to get a overview!

Look at the pillar.example to get a feeling on how you can modify:
* Backup local directories
* Backup remote directories
** Use a specific ssh identy file
** Populate the ssh identy files from your pillar
* Modify the retain strategy (hourly, daily) and the corresponding crontab entries

By default we backup every 4 hours, then daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly.

We ajusted the the priority of the backup to task (using nice -10 and ionice -c3) to minimize impacton you work while doing a backup.

The following manual steps might be necessary:
* The destination dir of the backup must be created manually (to avoid copying into a non mounted filesystem)
* To accept the host-id run manually the newly generated sync command. eg.
** sudo nice -10 ionice -c3 /usr/bin/rsnapshot -q -c /etc/rsnapshot_demo.conf sync

h2. TODO

* Create a script/salt state to fill all initial hourly, daily, weekly, etc backups.
* Create on each backup a human readable index which list all backups with name, date of creation, human readable time diff like "one week ago"
