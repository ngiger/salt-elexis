.h1 Setup of an Elexis IT infrastructure using salt

.h2 Installation and initil setup

.h3 Using virtual machines, eg. for testing

There is Vagrantfile which defines to VM, one called prxserver and another labor. The prxserver

* @vagrant init@

The call @vagrant ssh prxserver@ and @vagrant ssh labor@ respectively to ssh into the VM and continue with the setup for real machines.

.h3 Using real machines

* Client (Either Debian wheezy or Ubuntu precise)
** copy scripts/install_client.sh and execute it to install salt-minion

* Server (We assume debian jessie). Here we install salt-master and salt-minion to be able to configure the server, too.
** Call git clone URL /srv/salt
** execute /srv/salt/scripts/install_master.sh it to install salt-master

.h3 Adding and verifying minion keys on the master

* In the output @sudo salt-key -L@ you should  see a line like @Unaccepted Keys:@ followed @labor.local@
* Run @sudo salt-key -A@ and accept the keys
* Run @ sudo salt '*' test.ping@ to verify that you can

Targeting https://docs.saltstack.com/en/develop/topics/targeting/index.html

Salt allows for minions to be targeted based on a wide range of criteria. The default targeting system uses globular expressions to match minions, hence if there are minions named larry1, larry2, curly1, and curly2, a glob of larry* will match larry1 and larry2, and a glob of *1 will match larry1 and curly1.

Many other targeting systems can be used other than globs, these systems include:

Regular Expressions
    Target using PCRE-compliant regular expressions
Grains
    Target based on grains data: Targeting with Grains
Pillar
    Target based on pillar data: Targeting with Pillar
IP
    Target based on IP address/subnet/range

# sudo salt * saltutil.refresh_pillar
# sudo salt '*' pillar.items
# sudo salt labor* state.apply users Test=true -l debug


# working with environments see https://developer.rackspace.com/blog/marconi-and-salt-part-2/
sudo salt prxserver.local grains.setval environment prod
sudo /etc/init.d/salt-master restart
sudo salt prxserver.local grains.items
